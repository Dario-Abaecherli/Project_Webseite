                    <h4>Alpha Centauri - More</h4>
                    <p>Alpha Centauri A and B are Sun-like stars (Class G and K), and together they form the binary star Alpha Centauri AB. To the naked eye,
                         the two main components appear to be a single star with an apparent magnitude of −0.27, the brightest star in the southern constellation of
                          Centaurus and the third-brightest in the night sky, outshone only by Sirius and Canopus. </p>
                    <p class="smallScreen"> Alpha Centauri A has 1.1 times the mass and 1.519 times the luminosity of the Sun, while Alpha Centauri B is smaller
                         and cooler, at 0.907 times the Sun's mass and 0.445 times its luminosity. The pair orbit around a common centre with an orbital period of 79.91 years.
                         Their elliptical orbit is eccentric, so that the distance between A and B varies from 35.6 AU (astronomical units), or about the distance between Pluto
                          and the Sun, to 11.2 AU, or about the distance between Saturn and the Sun.
                          Alpha Centauri C, or Proxima Centauri, is a small and faint red dwarf (Class M).
                           Though not visible to the naked eye, Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at a distance of 4.24 light-years (1.30 pc),
                            slightly closer than Alpha Centauri AB. Currently, the distance between Proxima Centauri and Alpha Centauri AB is about 13,000 astronomical
                             units (0.21 ly), equivalent to about 430 times the radius of Neptune's orbit. </p>

                    <p>Alpha Centauri (Latinized from α Centauri, abbreviated Alpha Cen or α Cen) is the closest star system and closest planetary system to Earth's
                         Solar System at 4.37 light-years (1.34 parsecs) from the Sun. It is a triple star system, consisting of three stars: α Centauri A
                          (officially Rigil Kentaurus), α Centauri B (officially Toliman), and α Centauri C (officially Proxima Centauri).</p>

                    <h4>More about Sirius</h4>
                    <p>Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to the Solar System. At a distance of 2.64 parsecs (8.6 ly),
                         the Sirius system is one of Earth's nearest neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly
                          increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time, its distance will begin to increase, and it will become fainter,
                           but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.</p>
                    <p class="smallScreen">Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun (M☉) and has an absolute visual magnitude of +1.42.
                         It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun, but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel.
                          The system is between 200 and 300 million years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these,
                           Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white
                            dwarf around 120 million years ago.</p>

                    <h4>Sirius</h4>
                    <p>Sirius (/ˈsɪriəs/, designated α Canis Majoris (Latinized to Alpha Canis Majoris, abbreviated Alpha CMa, α CMa))
                         is the brightest star in the night sky. Its name is derived from the Greek word Σείριος Seirios "glowing" or "scorching".
                          With a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star.</p> 
                    <p class="smallScreen">Sirius is a binary star consisting of a main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint white
                         dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 astronomical
                          units as they orbit every 50 years.</p>

                    <h4>More of Kepler-186f</h4>
                    <p>The only physical property directly derivable to that of the central star, which follows from the amount of occultation of stellar light during a transit.
                         This ratio was measured to be 0.021, giving a planetary radius of 1.11±0.14 times that of Earth. The planet is about 11% larger in radius than
                          Earth (between 4.5% smaller and 26.5% larger), giving a volume about 1.37 times that of Earth (between 0.87 and 2.03 times as large).</p>
                    <p class="smallScreen">A very wide range of possible masses can be calculated by combining the radius with densities derived from the possible
                         types of matter from which planets can be made. For example, it could be a rocky terrestrial planet or a lower density ocean planet with a thick atmosphere.
                          A massive hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere is thought to be unlikely in a planet with a radius below 1.5 R⊕. Planets with a radius of more than
                           1.5 times that of Earth tend to accumulate the thick atmospheres which make them less likely to be habitable. Red dwarfs
                            emit a much stronger extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux when young than later in life. The planet's primordial atmosphere would have
                             been subjected to elevated photoevaporation during that period, which would probably have largely removed any H/He-rich envelope 
                             through hydrodynamic mass loss.</p>

                    <h4>Proxima centauri b - More</h4>
                    <p>Proxima Centauri b orbits the star at a distance of roughly 0.05 AU (7,500,000 km; 4,600,000 mi) with an orbital period of approximately
                         11.2 Earth days, and has an estimated mass of at least 1.2 times that of Earth. It is subject to stellar wind pressures of more than 2,000
                          times those of Earth from the solar wind, and its habitability has not yet been definitively established.</p>
                    <p class="smallScreen">The planet's discovery was announced in August 2016. It was found using the radial velocity method, where periodic Doppler
                         shifts of the parent star's spectral lines suggest an orbiting object. From these readings, the parent star's radial velocity relative to the Earth
                          is varying with an amplitude of about 1.4 metres (4.5 feet) per second.[2] According to Guillem Anglada‐Escudé, the planet's proximity to Earth offers
                           an opportunity for robotic exploration with the Starshot project or, at least, "in the coming centuries".
                        Without its orbital inclination known, Proxima Centauri b exact mass is unknown. If its orbit is nearly edge-on, it would have a mass of 1.173±0.086 M⊕
                         (Earth masses). Statistically, there is a roughly 90% chance that its mass is less than 2.77 M⊕.   
                        In May 2019, a paper presenting recent Spitzer Space Telescope data concluded that Proxima Centauri b did not transit its sun relative to Earth,
                         and attributed previous transit detections to correlated noise.</p>
